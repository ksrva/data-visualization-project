# data-visualization-project

This Data Visualization project focuses on visualizing data related to mental health in Ontario. 
The project aims to provide meaningful insights into mental health trends and statistics through the use of JFreeChart, 
a Java-based library for creating interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs. As the project manager, I 
was responsible for overseeing the development of the project and I created the geographical frame, which visualizes data based
on the different regions of Ontario.

FEATURES 

The geographical frame presents 3 visualizations: An interative map of Ontario divided by regions, as well as the a heat 
map and time series chart. The charts each have a control panel that users can use to filter, customize the chart, etc. to
gain a better understand the data.

DEPENDENCIES 

JFreeChart 1.5.3
